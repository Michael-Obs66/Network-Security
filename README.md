## Introduction

Cybersecurity is essential for protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. This repository focuses on foundational network security topics, practical shell scripts, and step-by-step lab exercises to help you build real-world skills.

---

## Features

- Shell scripts for network monitoring, scanning, and defense
- Practical exercises covering core cybersecurity concepts
- Step-by-step labs for hands-on learning
- Beginner-friendly explanations & documentation
- Expandable for advanced security topics

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Michael-Obs66/Network-Security.git
   cd Network-Security
   ```

2. **Review the available scripts and lab instructions.**

3. **Check prerequisites**: Most scripts require Bash and standard Linux utilities (`netstat`, `nmap`, etc.).

---

## Installation

No special installation is required for most scripts. For specific labs, you may need to install additional tools:

- **nmap**: Network scanning
- **Wireshark**: Packet analysis
- **tcpdump**: Network traffic capture

Install example (Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap wireshark tcpdump
```

---

## Usage

- Run scripts from the command line as shown in their documentation.
- Follow lab instructions in the repository to practice cybersecurity techniques.

Example:
```bash
bash ./scripts/network_scan.sh
```

---

## Lab Exercises

This section can include:

- **Network Scanning**: Using nmap to discover hosts and services
- **Traffic Analysis**: Capturing and analyzing packets with Wireshark/tcpdump
- **Firewall Setup**: Configuring iptables or ufw for host protection
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying weaknesses in a test environment
- **Incident Response**: Simulating detection and mitigation procedures

> _Add your own exercises, expand with new scripts, and document your learning!_
